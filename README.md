### How to play.
1. Find someone close to you.
2. One player will use the "W,S,A,D" keys (blue player), while the other will use the arrow keys (purple player).

3. The objective of the game is to get 100 points before the rival.
Every time your player eats a "donut" they will add two points and when they reach 100 the screen will turn the color of the winner.

Apart from the points, you will see how every time you eat your player will grow, like the image below.

You can play with any device with a keyboard as the game adapts to any screen.
